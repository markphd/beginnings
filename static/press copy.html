					<p>Sabrina Artadi handles business development for FedEx / Air2. But she juggles several other roles as well --- as mother, creator of hand - painted <i>jusi</i> clothing for her Sabrina's Silks line and soon, as the star of her own cooking show, which debut s on Lifestyle Network this month. With such a hectic lifestyle, she prefers a natural, fuss-free beauty regimen that often includes ingredients from an unusual source. "Believe it or not, I just grab things from the kitchen and whip up my own masks and body moisturizers when I need a quick beauty fix!"					</div>

They do it all --- raise a family, run a household, head a business, and look amazing in the process.

			<p>Sure, she doesn't look like a mom to tow grown kids (21-year-old Zeus, far right and Amouage, 20), but that's not the best compliment Sabrina Artadi has heard about herself. "When photographers take me, they see a sense of peacefulness in my presstures," says this 44-year-old with a smile.

That's what happens when you immerse yourself in the things you love. The designer of a resort wear and swim cover-up line called Marrakesh and her self-names line of hand-painted jusi, she also enjoys updating old homes' interiors and is the host of her very own cooking show on the Lifestyle Network. 

"You should never forget the things you love," avers Sabrina, who stays in shape by running every other day and eating in moderation. "Once you lose your spirit and you're no longer happy, then you can't be a good mom."

Speaking of that, Sabrina absolutely relishes the role of mother. "Every step was an incredible experience. From the time they were born to the time they started walking and talking, you can't believe it, you just have to peep in the room and see for yourself what a miracle you have," she says. "Of course, it comes with the discipline, and them making you thing about things, as well. But every minute," she insists, "is beautiful."</p></div>

			<p>When she chose and designed her living space, Sabrina Artadi did not solicit the help of any professional because she already knew what she wanted. She lives by the philosophy, "live like you are on vacation", so naturally, her home has a very relaxed atmosphere, with its jungle-like fell and very open spaces. Sabrina describes her style as "personal and full of personality". "I went for a boheme feel with some touches of Asia and Africa." Her favorite space in her home is the lanai because it is where she does the things she truly enjoys, one of which is entertaining. The drinks can go neatly behind the bar with her with her chilled wine, while her homemade pressa pressas can be passed around. The surrounding colors, plants, and decor bring out positive energy for her family and guests. Another passion that she cultivates in her lanai is creating. "I am happiest when I am creating," says Sabrina, and this room has been the inspiration for so many of her pieces, such as her Sabrina Silks and hand-painted jusi, which she returns into one-of-a-kind scarves, gowns and cocktail dresses. Most of Sabrina's day is spent in this space --- she cooks (her cooking show will air on the Lifestyle Network), designs, or creates art. Here, she finds comfort. "I must thank the good Lord who has given me the grace to learn the healing powers of being creative."

<p>When they aren't sharing the house with others, Sabrina, Bob, and their kids are only too happy to have it all to themselves. On weekends, the lady, who handles business development for FedEx and Air 21, will drive off with her brood to Batangas, where they spend the day lounging around, enjoying the blessing that is theirs.  After watching the sunset, a spectacular event by Sabrina's account, the family will make the trip back to their city home in Alabang. 

"It's always hard to leave," she admits with a sign. Thank God for weekends.
